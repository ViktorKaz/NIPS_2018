# Machine Learning AUtomation Toolbox (MLAUT)

These are the code examples that complement the sumbission for the [NIPS Machine Learning Open Source Software 2018: Sustainable communities](https://2018.mloss.org/).

The code examples are presented the as frozen Jupyter Notebooks. The underlying code might not have been released in the public domain at the time of the peer review of the manuscript but will be released under an Open Source licence by December 2018.

### Abstract

In this paper we present MLAUT (Machine Learning AUtomation Toolbox) for the python data science ecosystem. MLAUT automates large-scale evaluation and benchmarking of machine learning algorithms on a large number of datasets. MLAUT provides a high-level workflow interface to machine algorithm algorithms, implements a local back-end to a database of dataset collections, trained algorithms, and experimental results, and provides easy-to-use interfaces to the scikit-learn and keras modelling libraries. Experiments are easy to set up with default settings in a few lines of code, while remaining fully customizable to the level of hyper-parameter tuning, pipeline composition, or deep learning architecture.

This is a short (``extended abstract'') version, abridged for the NIPS submission prior to the public release of MLAUT, of a longer manuscript which also includes: full mathematical background and description of implemented post-hoc analyses, a detailed overview of the package design, and results of a large-scale benchmarking study conducted with MLAUT.
